# The Farmer Was Replaced

I use foo to type up whatever I'm doing now, main to run it as a leaderboard run.

## Times (as of 2026-01-04)

Lots of code cleaning to be done, but my times:

| Challenge | Time | Rank |
|-----------|------|------|
| Cactus Single | 00:24.674 | #36 |
| Dinosaur | 17:45.008 | #68 |
| Maze | 02:27.768 | #23 |
| Maze Single | 02:41.476 | #21 |
| Pumpkins | 07:33.905 | #40 |

## Cactus Single

This algorithm is one I came up with from trial and error. I have no mathematical reason to know it works. It just hasn't failed. It's sort of like if an insertion sort carried light items to the bottom left, heavy items to the top right.

## Maze

My best time was just with a BFS. Nothing special going on here really. A* was too expensive for a 6x6, and my time was done using 25 6x6 mazes.

## Maze Single

Still BFS

## Pumpkins

16 patches of 6x6 pumpkins with 2 drones each. The amount of water and fertilizer to use was just trial and error.
